    <div class="how-to-cook">
        <p>
            Start by heating the oil in a small saucepan. Use a neutral oil like canola. Once hot, add the cumin seeds. As soon as the seeds begin to sizzle, add in the sliced garlic. The garlic and cumin seeds will deepen in color. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            When the garlic reaches a pale golden shade, immediately remove the oil from the heat. As long as the oil remains in the pan, the residual heat will continue cooking the spices, so transfer the cumin oil into a heatproof bowl. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The most crucial part here is to observe the oil through each step. The oil should be hot but not smoking. If at any point it feels like the cumin or garlic is darkening too quickly, immediately remove the pan from the heat and pour the oil into a heatproof bowl to stop the cooking process. Burnt spices and garlic are bitter and inedible. Start over if this happens.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <P>
            Here are some thoughtful ingredient substitutions that work: 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>          
            For a lighter version, instead of using full-fat coconut milk, use light coconut milk. Note that the soup will have a thinner consistency, so start with half the amount of vegetable stock, then add more if necessary.
             </p>
             <br>
             <p>
            If you don't have garam masala handy or can't find it at your local grocery store, you can make it at home.
